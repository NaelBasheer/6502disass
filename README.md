#6502 disassembler 


Because we can't have too many.

This is a very.. Uh.. *spartan* disassembler that is meant as a research project by Mohammed "Tanjoodo" Arabiat and Nael "NaelBasheer" Al-Basheer.

##Features

It can like take a binary file and make sense of it in terms of 6502 assembly. It does not respect data and text bounds or handle padding correctly. Without recompiling it to your desired start point, you will have the padding translated into assembly.

It also doesn't export an assembly file yet. It probably also has some errors in it.
